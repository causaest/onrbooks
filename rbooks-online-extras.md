### Machine Learning

01. Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models, by Max Kuhn, Kjell Johnson: https://bookdown.org/max/FES/

An excellent book about feature engineering, sadly unmaintained.

### Specialized Applications

01. Introduction to Econometrics with R, by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, Martin Schmelzer: https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/

An R companion to the textbook "Introduction to Econometrics" by James H. Stock and W. Watson, which is a good resource for regression and inference for any other application, too.

02. Tidy Finance with R, by Christoph Scheuch, Stefan Voigt, Patrick Weiss: https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/

Reproducible finance with R, the "tidyverse" way. The book is only for quants or analysts dealing with financial data.

03. Building reproducible analytical pipelines with by Bruno Rodrigues: https://raps-with-r.dev/

This book brings best practices from software engineering and DevOps to R programming.

04. Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling, by Alicia A. Johnson, Miles Q. Ott, Mine Dogucu: https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/

Bayesian modeling in R, not updated since 2021.

05. Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps, by Colin Fay, Sébastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader, Cervan Girard: https://engineering-shiny.org/

The book discusses the process of building Shiny applications for production. It's built around the package golem, a toolkit for simplifying the creation, development and deployment of Shiny apps. Only for Shiny professionals.

06. Let's Git started, by Jennifer Bryan: https://happygitwithr.com/

Covers key workflows to integrate Git and GitHub into daily work with R and R Markdown.

07. Surrogates: Gaussian process modeling, design and optimization for the applied sciences, by Robert B. Gramacy: https://bookdown.org/rbg/surrogates/

In statistics, predictive equations derived from a fitted model can act as a surrogate (a substitute) for the data-generating mechanism. Gathering data is expensive, and sometimes getting exactly the data you want is impossible or unethical; a surrogate could represent a much cheaper way to explore relationships, and entertain "what ifs?".

08. Flexible Imputation of Missing Data, by Stef van Buuren: https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/

The best online resource on missing data imputation, focusing more on multiple imputation approaches. Not updated since 2018: https://github.com/stefvanbuuren/fimdbook.

09. An Introduction to Text Processing and Analysis with R, by Michael Clark: https://m-clark.github.io/text-analysis-with-R/

A workshop about text analysis in R. Not updated since 2018: https://github.com/m-clark/text-analysis-with-R.

10. Mastering Spark with R, by Javier Luraschi, Kevin Kuo, Edgar Ruiz: https://therinspark.com/
