# Online R books - Main

A short list of online R books I use often.

01. Advanced R (2nd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/

I often go to this resource when I need to go deeper into a topic related to R programming (data structures, control flow, environments, functional programming, object-oriented programming, debugging, profiling, etc.) 

02. Advanced R Solutions, by Malte Grosser, Henning Bumann, and Hadley Wickham: https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/

The book provides solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham's "Advanced R" book. It's rather uninteresting as a standalone reference, but it's great for self-learning, as a valuable companion to "Advanced R".

03. An Introduction to R, by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Francesca Mancini, Ana Couto, and David Lusseau: https://intro2r.com/

A truly introductory book; you can start here and learn a little bit about all the R basics. I don't really end up here quite often when searching for a resource, but I really like the two chapters at the end, "Reproducible reports with R markdown" and "Version control with Git and GitHub", which are short but very practical. The rest of the book covers the basics about data wrangling, graphics, simple statistics, programming; the usual stuff.

04. Applied Machine Learning Using mlr3 in R, by Bernd Bischl, Raphael Sonabend, Lars Kotthoff, and Michel Lang: https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/

This is the online version of the print book with the same title, which is about 350 pages long. The mlr3 ecosystem "provides a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for regression, classification, and other machine learning tasks". In general, mlr3 is more advanced than tidymodels.

05. Deep R Programming, by Marek Gagolewski: https://deepr.gagolewski.com/

This book could be seen as a rival (or a complement, depending on the attitude) of Hadley Wickham's Advanced R. Extra point here because there is a download option for a beautifully typesetted PDF version; however, the paper version is very cheap. Content-wise, it's a comprehensive and in-depth resource about data structures, functions, classes, environments, and other programming concepts, quite suitable as a self learning resource.

06. Efficient R programming, by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace: https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/

Although this book has'nt been updated over the last few years, it's quite unique in the areas of computational efficiency, vectorised code, profiling, and other topics in efficient R programming. The "Efficient Workflow" chapter is a great read.

07. Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd Ed.), by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos: https://otexts.com/fpp2/

The second edition of *Forecasting: Principles & Practice*, which uses the forecast package. This book is a comprehensive introduction to time series forecasting methods, decomposition, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, etc.

08. Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd Ed.), by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos: https://otexts.com/fpp3/

The third edition of *Forecasting: Principles & Practice*, which uses the fpp3 package and other packages that handle time series and forecasting in a tidy framework.

09. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3rd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen: https://ggplot2-book.org/

The standard resource for ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics, which helps understand the ggplot2 concepts and the underlying theory.

10. Hands-On Machine Learning with R, by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell: https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/

An introduction to the most common machine learning concepts and methods. The book hasn't been updated since 2020 and is still based on the caret package, which is currently in maintenance mode. I'm searching for a more up-to-date alternative.

11. Hands-On Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/

An introduction for non-programmers to the R language, covering topics such as R objects, functions, classes. The GitHub repo hasn't been updated since 2019, while the print version dates back to 2014. 

12. Mastering Shiny, by Hadley Wickham: https://mastering-shiny.org/

The best resource for learning Shiny and best practices around developing Shiny apps, providing a deep understanding of reactive programming.

13. Mastering Shiny Solutions, by Howard Baek: https://mastering-shiny-solutions.netlify.app/

Solutions manual for the exercises in the "Mastering Shiny" book. This book serves as an updated version of "Mastering Shiny Solutions" by Maya Gans and Marly Gotti, released in 2021.

14. Modern Data Visualization with R, by Robert Kabacoff: https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/

An overview of the most popular data visualization using ggplot2. It's much more user-friendly compared to "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis", so it's a great learning resource. The print book is 272 pages long.

15. Modern Statistics with R: From wrangling and exploring data to inference and predictive modelling, by Måns Thulin: https://modernstatisticswithr.com/

The online version of the second edition of "Modern Statistics with R". It introduces key parts of the modern statistical toolkit such as statistical inference, exploratory data analysis, dealing with messy data, simulation, regression, survival analysis, structural equation models, predictive modelling, with a little bit of R programming.

16. R for Data Science (2nd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/

I would call this book "R for Analytics" and I would recommend it to any R beginner. It has a rather distinct and pedagogical structure, starting with visualization and transformation of data. Then, it goes into data importing and tidying. Moreover, it's quite comprehensive and actively developed. The only issue is that it takes the reader directly into the tidyverse, so base R is only partially covered.

17. R Graphics Cookbook (2nd Ed.), by Winston Chang: https://r-graphics.org/

A practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help generate high-quality graphs quickly using base R and ggplot2. I'm not a huge fan of cookbooks myself, but this book can serve as a useful reference.

18. R Markdown Cookbook, by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/

This book was created by drawing together popular posts from Stack Overflow and other online resources (such as blog posts or tutorials) to provide up-to-date solutions for everyday queries that users commonly make about the usage of R Markdown. It provides practical and relatively short examples, divided into topics for easier navigation. A gem.

19. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, by Yihui Xie, Joseph J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/

This book serves as a reference book about R Markdown, with lost of technical details. The "How to read this book" section is one of the best I've read.

20. R Packages (2nd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan: https://r-pkgs.org/

A book that teaches how to create an R package, "the fundamental unit of shareable, reusable, and reproducible R code". The first chapter runs through the development of a small toy package, which is a great idea; however, this toy package is a rather dull example.

21. Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse, by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim: https://moderndive.com/

22. Tidy Modeling with R, by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge: https://www.tmwr.org/

A guide to using tidymodels, covering concepts such as eExploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model tuning and selection, and model evaluation.
