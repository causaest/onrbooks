# Online R books

A short list of high-quality online R books.

01. Advanced R (2nd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/

I often go to this resource when I need to go deeper into a topic related to R programming (data structures, control flow, environments, functional programming, object-oriented programming, debugging, profiling, etc.) 

02. Advanced R Solutions, by Malte Grosser, Henning Bumann, and Hadley Wickham: https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/

The book provides solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham's "Advanced R" book. It's rather uninteresting as a standalone reference, but it's great for self-learning, as a valuable companion to "Advanced R".

03. An Introduction to R, by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Francesca Mancini, Ana Couto, and David Lusseau: https://intro2r.com/

A truly introductory book; you can start here and learn a little bit about all the R basics. I don't really end up here quite often when searching for a resource, but I really like the two chapters at the end, "Reproducible reports with R markdown" and "Version control with Git and GitHub", which are short but very practical. The rest of the book covers the basics about data wrangling, graphics, simple statistics, programming; the usual stuff.

04. Applied Machine Learning Using mlr3 in R, by Bernd Bischl, Raphael Sonabend, Lars Kotthoff, and Michel Lang: https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/

This is the online version of the print book with the same title, which is about 350 pages long. The mlr3 ecosystem "provides a generic, object-oriented, and extensible framework for regression, classification, and other machine learning tasks". In general, mlr3 is more advanced than tidymodels.

05. Deep R Programming, by Marek Gagolewski: https://deepr.gagolewski.com/

This book could be seen as a rival (or a complement, depending on the attitude) of Hadley Wickham's Advanced R. Extra point here because there is a download option for a beautifully typesetted PDF version; however, the paper version is very cheap. Content-wise, it's a comprehensive and in-depth resource about data structures, functions, classes, environments, and other programming concepts, quite suitable as a self learning resource.

06. Efficient R programming, by Colin Gillespie and Robin Lovelace: https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/

Although this book has'nt been updated over the last few years, it's quite unique in the areas of computational efficiency, vectorised code, profiling, and other topics in efficient R programming. The "Efficient Workflow" chapter is a great read.

07. Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd Ed.), by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos: https://otexts.com/fpp2/

The second edition of the book, which uses the forecast package. A comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods such as time series, decomposition, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, etc.

08. Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd Ed.), by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos: https://otexts.com/fpp3/

The third edition of the book, which uses the fpp3 package, which includes packages to handle time series and forecasting in a tidy framework.

09. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3rd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen: https://ggplot2-book.org/

A book introducing ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics.

10. Hands-On Machine Learning with R, by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell: https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/

An introduction to the most common machine learning methods, using the caret package.

11. Hands-On Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/

An introduction for non-programmers to the R language, data objects, functions, classes, and other programming tools.

12. Mastering Shiny, by Hadley Wickham: https://mastering-shiny.org/

A book for learning Shiny, a framework for creating web applications using R, providing a deep understanding of reactive programming.

13. Mastering Shiny Solutions, by Maya Gans and Marly Gotti: https://mastering-shiny-solutions.netlify.app/

A solutions manual for the exercises in the "Mastering Shiny" book.

14. Modern Data Visualization with R, by Robert Kabacoff: https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/

A comprehensive overview of data visualization using ggplot2.

15. Modern Statistics with R: From wrangling and exploring data to inference and predictive modelling, by Måns Thulin: https://modernstatisticswithr.com/

A book that introduces key parts of the modern statistical toolkit such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, predictive modelling, simulation, ethics in statistics, and R programming.

16. R for Data Science (2nd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/

A book that teaches how to get data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it and visualize, including concepts such as the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research.

17. R Graphics Cookbook (2nd Ed.), by Winston Chang: https://r-graphics.org/

A practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help generate high-quality graphs quickly using ggplot2.

18. R Markdown Cookbook, by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/

A book that provides practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown.

19. R Markdown: The Definitive Guide, by Yihui Xie, Joseph J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/

A book that serves as a reference book about R Markdown.

20. R Packages (2nd Ed.), by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan: https://r-pkgs.org/

A book that teaches how to create an R package, the fundamental unit of shareable, reusable, and reproducible R code.

21. Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse, by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim: https://moderndive.com/

22. Tidy Modeling with R, by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge: https://www.tmwr.org/

A guide to using tidymodels, covering concepts such as eExploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model tuning and selection, and model evaluation.
